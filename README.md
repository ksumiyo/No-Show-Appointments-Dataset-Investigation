# No-Show-Appointments-Dataset-Investigation

This repository contains a csv file, which contains patient and appointment information, and a Jupyter Notebook that contains an exploration of the contents of the csv file, focusing heavily on the trends of no-shows. The notebook attempts to analyze patterns and correlations between different health conditions and the rates of no-show, including the effects of compiling multiple health conditions.
