# No-Show-Appointments-Dataset-Investigation

The Jupyter Notebook contained in this repository is an exploration of the csv file, which contains patient and appointment information, including whether or not the patient showed up to their appointment. The notebook attempts to analyze patterns and correlations between different health conditions and the rates of no-show, including the effects of compiling multiple health conditions.
